Minecraft creeper sound project

Purpose:  Arduino based project that detects a persons proximity via PING sensor and plays one of three Creeper sound files.
My specific use was to fit the electronics into a scale model of a Creeper.

Requirements

Hardware :

1. Arduino board - I used the UNO
2. Adafruit Wave shield
3. Speaker/amplifier
4. Ultrasonic sensor - I used the Parallax PING

Software:

1. Arduino editor/compiler - I used 1.0.5
2. WaveHC https://code.google.com/p/wavehc/
